# lunchList
Gets list of restaurants near you so you can easily create a plan for visiting them all.

Currently uses a boundbox for location as seen in the yelp api search doc: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api


Outputs a randomized list so you don't bias yourself in your quest to eat at all the spots.

Only searches through 400 but you can change that if you want.
